# Challenge 22 - Diseases

IDEAS

Autogenerate:
- disease picture / body / limbs / organs
- disease name
- disease geneology
- disease vectors
- Disease environments
- treatments
- disease effects
- disease lifecycle
- disease DNA based permutation
- disease foodchain

## Vectors

How the disease (Bacteria, Fungus, Virus) spreads

## Environments

Where the disease lives

## Effects

What effects the disease yields in its victims. E.g., "Brain Hemmhoraging", "Tumors", "Cold", "Immuno Difficiency", etc..

## Disease Lifecycle

The varying stages the disease could exist in. E.g. several parasitic worms and creatures start live in a pond, eaten by frogs, frogs eaten by birds, reproduce in bird stomach, bird lands in pond, release eggs, die, repeat.

## Disease Name

Cool sounding name, scientific and "common" name

## Disease Geneology

Actual inheritance based geneology, building entire biomes
