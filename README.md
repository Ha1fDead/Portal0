My Webserver

This is my personal NodeJs webserver. In particular, I wanted to host a few things here:

- Links to all relevant projects
- Brief descriptions and summaries of my projects
- A Blog (that I may or may not write in)
- Hosting area for my Dungeons and Dragons content
- Relevant tools that I have created to make my life easier
- Completely move away from LinkedIn as my professional area (why use a linkedin as a web developer? seems awful)

## Design Considerations

1. Mobile friendly
2. Try to use as few packages as possible*
3. Attempt to design and build website without using a template
4. Attempt to build things using my new core paradigms, good coding styles, and clean html/css
5. Maintain documentation and workflows as I build the website, instead of pushing them off

> Notable Exceptions are MongoDb, Express, Angular, and Nodejs (MEAN)

## Reasoning

1. So I can learn more fundamentals of web technologies first and foremost
2. Improve my design skills with hands-on experience

## Installed Packages

- NodeJs
- AngularJs
- Express
- Sass


## How it all Works

ExpressJS acts as the actual webserver, allowing me to dynamically serve content (static files, webapi, etc.).

# Todo

1. Build out template engine (so I can remove boilerplate)
2. Build out DnD Worldbuilder
3. Further flesh out site design & layout
4. Import & fix all of my old school projects
5. Fix the damned footer for when the page size goes beyond it
6. Cleanup resume page
7. Get the girlfriend to design me a logo
8. Include a picture of me
9. Setup TLS
10. Verify mobile page works & flows
11. Setup auto-deploy
12. Setup separate git project for DnD worldbuilder & how to auto import it when changes are made
13. Figure out how to auto commit / sync using Visual Studio Code w/ Github

## School Projects to import:
