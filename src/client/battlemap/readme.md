# Purpose

- I dislike existing solutions to Tabletop RPG digital battlemaps. Most are clunky, laggy, and unyieldy with layers of crap added onto them

# Goals:

1. a map that can render a static hex grid
1. A generic grid with multiple "edge" possibilities (3,4,6 edge possibilities)
1. ability to "move" and "drag" the map
1. ability to "zoom in" and "zoom out" of the map
1. 'infinite' hex support
1. being able to import "tokens" into the map
1. being able to "move" tokens, animate token movement
1. Multiple, user-defined layer support
1. Multiple users supported, with multiple having "ownership" of the editor tools, pawns, and tokens
1. "locking" features for grids, pawns, and objects
1. tokens and objects can "snap" to the grid
1. arrow keys, intelligent hotkey support

## Future Features
- 3 dimension "map"
- Token "animation" options
- map state 'saving'
- light editing, light collision
- 3d object support
- being able to "color" backgrounds of nodes or "draw" on the map
- discord audio integration
- integrated chat system for players (Discord?)
- video interface
- "smart" movement interface, specify certain tiles as "navigable" by certain players
- "prefab" tokens, smart placement (walls go on edges of tiles)
- "undo" and "redo" functionality

### Super Stretch Goals
1. Integrate w/ Jordan's 'dnez' project for RPG support, automation of common utilities
