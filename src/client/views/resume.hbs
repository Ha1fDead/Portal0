        <h2>Known Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            I don't really like putting this list here, but I know some people care about it. My view of technology is
            that you should quickly be able to learn a new technology and begin applying its best practices.
            While deep experience is a must for core Computer Science / Engineering problems, most technologies don't
            require that level of knowledge to utilize effectively.
