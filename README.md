My Webserver

This is my personal NodeJs webserver. In particular, I wanted to host a few things here:

- Links to all relevant projects
- Brief descriptions and summaries of my projects
- A Blog (that I may or may not write in)
- Hosting area for my Dungeons and Dragons content
- Relevant tools that I have created to make my life easier
- Completely move away from LinkedIn as my professional area (why use a linkedin as a web developer? seems awful)

## Design Considerations

1. Mobile friendly
2. Try to use as few packages as possible*
3. Attempt to design and build website without using a template
4. Attempt to build things using my new core paradigms, good coding styles, and clean html/css
5. Maintain documentation and workflows as I build the website, instead of pushing them off

> Notable Exceptions are MongoDb, Express, Angular, and Nodejs (MEAN)

## Reasoning

1. So I can learn more fundamentals of web technologies first and foremost
2. Improve my design skills with hands-on experience

## Installed Packages

- NodeJs
- AngularJs
- Express
- Sass
- Handlebars (HBS)

## How it all Works

ExpressJS acts as the actual webserver, allowing me to dynamically serve content (static files, webapi, etc.).

When a request hits one of my endpoints, the app will compile the handlebars code and send it as an html file to the client.

On dev, I have SCSS middleware which will automatically compile whenever my routes are hit

Build:
1. scss is compiled & put into Client/content/css/main.css
2. typescript is compiled & bundled (using webpack) to Client/content/scripts/bundle.js

Dev:
1. webpack is setup to run concurrently, will auto compile typescript files when changes are detected

Startup:
1. Register all node dependencies
2. Start expressjs server
3. Load middleware

Server:
1. Endpoint is hit, compile associated .hbs file (converts to html), send back to client
2. Endpoint is hit, send static files

DnD Webapp:
1. React & react dependencies are loaded from server
2. React loads, initializes components & binds to DOM

### Setting up React & Typescript

1. Install react/react-dom dependencies
2. Convert all files to .ts/.tsx
3. Install webpack dependency (ts react will NOT work without it)
4. Install awesome-typescript-loader (again, ts react will NOT work without it)

# Site Design & Layout todo

1. Setup grid / flexbox layout
1. Verify mobile page works & flows
1. Learn what the meta viewport property does cross-browser
1. Wrap the header float'd list in a div so it wraps properly

1. verify nodejs & nginx restarts with server reboot
1. setup some form of analytics to see website hits
1. include robots.txt file
