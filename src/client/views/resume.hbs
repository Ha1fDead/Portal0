    <p>This is my resume! I got rid my LinkedIn. 
        Long story short, I am currently seeking employment in the Minneapolis / Saint Paul area.

        Here's a short list of who I am:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Graduated from Iowa State University (2010 - 2015)</li>
        <li>Degree in Computer Engineering (3.07 GPA) (Networking emphasis)</li>

        <li>AngularJs (both versions)</li>
        <li>Computer networking (entire OSI stack)</li>
        <li>The <strong>entire</strong> web-stack</li>
        <li>Anything with good/great documentation</li>

        <li>Accessibility matters</li>
        <li>Designing something <strong>before</strong> implementing it</li>

        <li>Use my tools to my advantage, whenever possible</li>

        <li>Believe in self-documenting code (even if its a lie)</li>
        <li>Try to automate as much as possible</li>
        <li>Try to break things up into bite-sized chunks</li>

        <li>Results-driven development</li>
        <li>If I can't explain something to you, its either too complicated (and can be simplified) or I need to learn more about the topic</li>
        <li>IE &lt; 11 is the worst and should be ditched ASAP</li>
        <li>Believe that web frameworks are a dime-a-dozen and yours isn't very special.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm looking for an employer who...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cares about their employees</li>
        <li>Cares about best-practices (business, engineering, customer, design, etc.)</li>
        <li>Cares about results-driven development instead of ass-in-chair development</li>
        <li>Cares about healthy work-life balance (40-45 hrs/week)</li>
        <li>Cares about information security</li>
        <li>Can offer a competitive offer</li>

        <li>Reasonable health package (Eye/Dental/Health)</li>
        <li>Reasonable pay / bonus / review structure</li>
